--> Business Problem: <br>
 
      In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest 
      heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection,forcing the anti-malware groups/communities 
      to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks.
      The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify
      whether a given piece of file/software is a malware. 
      
--> Objective <br>
     
    1) Minimize multi-class error.
    2) Multi-class probability estimates.
    3) Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer.
       It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute.

For every malware, we have two files

     1) .asm file 
     2) .bytes file 

    Total train dataset consist of 200GB data out of which 50Gb of data is .bytes files
    and 150GB of data is .asm files:
    Lots of Data for a single-box/computer.
    There are total 10,868 .bytes files and 10,868 asm files total 21,736 files
    There are 9 types of malwares (9 classes) in our give data
